Characteristics of Strings
1. Immututable - cannot do changes

Characteristics of Lists

Operations on Strings
1. Concatenation  + to add strings
2. Repetition * to multiply    for eg. a=b*21 will print b 21 times
3. Comparison ==,<=,>=,!=
4. Membership - in, not in
    eg. P="Python is great"
        Python in P= 
        If Python is present in P then return True otherwise False
        Java not in P=
        If Java is not present in P then return True otherwise False
5. Indexing
6. String Methods: used for changing case(upper-lower), finding substrings, spilitting
        eg. a="hello world"
        case=a.upper()
        words=a.split()
7. String Formatting: str.format()
    name='alice'
    age=30
    mess=f'my name is {name} and i am {age} years old

DYNAMIC TYPING
* data type of a variable is determined at runtime rather than being declared at creation time
* means var can hold values of different data types during its lifetime and can change the data type of  a variable by assigning a value of a different type to it
* NO EXPLICIT TYPE DECLARATIONS
